      <description>How Do U Respond To Danke? When someone says danke, the standard response is bitte. This normally means &amp;lsquo;please&amp;rsquo;, but within the context of responding to a &amp;rsquo;thank you&amp;rsquo;, it means &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo;re welcome&amp;rsquo;. If instead they say danke sch√∂n, then you should reply by saying bitte sch√∂n.

      <description>How Does Bpg Affect Hemoglobin? That is, by binding to hemoglobin, 2,3-BPG decreases hemoglobins affinity for oxygen, thereby shifting the entire oxygen-binding curve to the right side. This is what allows the hemoglobin to act as an effective oxygen carrier in the body, unloading about 66% of oxygen to exercising tissue.

      <description>How Does Bpg Affect Oxygen Loading And Unloading? 2,3-BPG binds to hemoglobin which causes the unloading of oxygen. Additionally, 2,3-BPG decreases the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. As hemoglobin is unloaded in our tissues, 2,3-BPG binds to the hemoglobin and thus favors unloading of oxygen.

      <description>How Does Bpg Decrease The Affinity Of Hemoglobin For Oxygen? How does BPG binding to hemoglobin decrease its affinity for oxygen? Ans: BPG binds to a cavity between the subunits. It binds preferentially to molecules in the low-affinity T state, thereby stabilizing that conformation.

      <description>How Does Bpg Help At High Altitudes? Increasing the concentration of 2,3-BPG in our blood shifts the oxygen binding curve to the right side. This means that hemoglobin will have a lower affinity for oxygen and will be able to release more oxygen to the tissues and cells of our body.
